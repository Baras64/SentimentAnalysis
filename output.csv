"Amazon,
I am shopping for Amazon.com gift cards for Christmas gifts and am really so disappointed that out of five choices there isn't one that says ""Merry Christmas"" or mentions Christmas at all!  I am sure I am not alone in wanting a card that reflects the actual ""holiday"" we are celebrating. On principle, I cannot send a Amazon gift card this Christmas.  What's up with all the Political Correctness?  Bad marketing decision.

"I got this gift card from a friend, and it was the best! The site has so much to choose from... great gift.",5,Positive
"aren't we going to save trees?! :) People who were complaining about paper gift cards can simply buy an electronic gift card via email. It's very convenient and indeed a great gift. I found paper gift cards annoying since you have to always wonder how much money you got left on it. And if you lose it, you lose it. An electronic delivery of the gift card makes it a lot of easier to redeem, you only need to COPY/PASTE the code into your gift certificate balance and it'll be there whenever you want to use it.

I've sent friends electronic gift cards via email for their newborns, for their weddings, and for their housewarmings. :)

Happy holidays",5,Positive
"You can always get someone something from Amazon with the safety net that they can return it if they don't like it. But returning things is such a hassle. The card takes care of that--no more returns, no more hassles.",1,Negative
"Why take 50 dollars of good money with no limitations, and turn it into Amazon money that can only be used at their site? Where is the benefit?

Also, you spend time and headache buying these types of cards, dealing with any activation issues risking expiration or delivery issues and then you have to keep up with them and keep track of how much you have remaining on the card....

They should at least give a discount for committing your purchasing power to them...",1,Neutral
Gift Cards are the truly personal gift.  My only problem is after I received it and could have given it away as a gift I got an email from Amazon - whoops we forgot to activate your card.  Be sure your card is good before giving as a gift.  Amazon is very good about notifying and doing refunds but this could leave a procrastinator in the lurch with a bad gift which really will be good when Amazon knows the problem.  Kudos for the quick second card and I've checked it and it's fully loaded.  Thanks!,1,Negative
"I am a dedicated Amazon.com shopper, and, am almost always happy. That being said, please note the top of the page should you be an Amazon Prime member. I NEVER thought that Gift Cards from Amazon.com would be subject to additional shipping and handling... The charge to me for two cards? Over $13.",5,Positive
"Bought three $50 gift cards as gifts, received them and mailed them out.  One week letter Amazon emailed me that the cards could not be activated and were no good and they were so sorry.  I contacted Amazon and they could not explain what happened but again they were ""sorry"".  So I had to contact recipients and explain their gift was worthless.  7 days later I'm still waiting for a refund to my credit card.

Don't order these-the same thing could happen to you.  How embarrassing to give these as gifts.",1,Negative
At this time of year Amazon gift cards are turning out to be the best gifts to give and I'm glad now that I can buy them by putting them in my cart with other products instead of having to order them separately.,5,Positive
"I bought 8 gift cards to give out as presents.  I was totally surprised that they came sealed inside the Amazon envelopes.  I cannot sign the cards without opening therefore damaging the envelopes.  I asked Amazon to ship me replacement envelopes but they are not able to do that as in the following response.

""Thank you for contacting us at Amazon.com. I'm sorry to hear that the gift card envelopes were damaged when opening it. I do understand your concern in this regard. Unfortunately, we are unable to replace the envelopes only as we do not have any stock of additional gift card envelopes. Hope you can understand our limitations in this matter.""

Please do not buy these cards.",1,Negative

I got a $50 gift card as a gift from someone else. When I opened the card from the cardboard holder I discovered that the claim code was not fully readable. After contacting customer service they stated that the gift card was already used! ...how can a gift card in it packaging be used?!? My claim was escalated to someone else. Their customer service has been horrible and I'm waiting to hear what they will find. I didn't get an email that they had gotten my email until the next day and the representative in the phone was not very friendly.,1,Negative

"I purchased six $50 Amazon Gift Cards from a local supermarket (Bi Lo) to give as Christmas Gifts in 2015 (something I've done for many years). My Sister-in-law, the recipient of one of those $50 Amazon Gift Cards called me to say that she's lost the Gift Card (most likely accidentally discarded with all of the Christmas paper, etc. and burned in the trash). I told her ""no problem"", since I had kept my receipt from Bi Lo that includes the Amazon Gift Card Number, and I felt certain that Amazon would be able to see that no purchases had been made against their Gift Card Number and that either Amazon or Bi Lo would be able to cancel that card and issue a new one, or Credit her online Amazon Account $50 and bypass issuing a new physical card altogether. I was sadly mistaken.... when she initially contacted Amazon, they told her that since the Amazon Card was purchased from Bi Lo, we would need to take the matter up with them. I went to Bi Lo and was told that there wasn't anything that they could do and that I would need to contact Amazon. Since my Sister-in-law had already contacted Amazon and been turned away, I decided since I was the one who made the purchase and had the receipt, I would call my Credit Card Company first to see if they might be able to offer some assistance in getting the matter resolved since I had purchased all of the Gift Cards with my Credit Card. After 30 minutes discussing the details with my Credit Card Company, they said they understood my dilemma but weren't able to dispute the charge with Bi Lo. They suggested I contact Amazon directly since I had my receipt with Amazon's Gift Card number on and since it was Amazon's gift card. So... after about 30 minutes on the phone with a very nice gentleman from Amazon who made 2 attempts to get his Supervisor to approve some type of credit for the loss, he sadly informed me that Amazon isn't responsible for purchases of their Gift Cards that aren't made from their website. I told him that since Amazon isn't willing to offer any assistance, even though they can clearly see in their system a $50 unused Credit on that lost Gift Card and since I had my receipt with their Gift Card number printed on the receipt (proof that I had purchased their Gift Card), I felt as though Amazon had ROBBED me of $50, since the only one who will benefit financially from this gift transaction is Amazon and I had certainly not intended to add ""Amazon"" as one of my 2015 Christmas names to buy for! Furthermore, I told him that I would not be making any more purchases from Amazon directly or purchasing any other Amazon Gift Cards in the future and would encourage others to do the same. I try not to support businesses that engage in thievery, and that is exactly how I feel I was treated in this instance.",1,Negative

"Amazon gift cards are the biggest fraud I have ever seen! My husband was issued a $50 gift card from his work over a year ago and had been waiting to use it on something he or I needed. With Christmas just around the corner he and I thought it would be a great idea to use the gift card to buy gifts with. My husband spent $24 dollars and change leaving me a balance of $25 dollars to use if I wanted to buy something. I thought hey this is perfect! I can buy my nephew the movie he asked for and a few other small items for stockings and not break the bank.

Well of course life doesn't work out the way it is supposed to. Because my husband and I each have our own Amazon accounts, created before we were married, and maintained for buying the surprise birthday, Christmas, or anniversary gift. And here is where the CATCH comes in... Any purchases or that were made on an Amazon gift card, or if a gift card was even just registered under a particular individual/account can not be used or shared by someone else. The powers that be at Amazon consider that transferring. This includes any minor children that may have an account not just your spouse. Which means...I would have to spend personal money out of pocket if I wanted to still buy these items off Amazon, instead of using a perfectly good gift card that would have covered the balance. Or the other option which was never suggested was log into my husbands account not look at what he bought me in his previous purchase section and buy what I wanted for my nephew and kids on my husbands account only after I ask him for his password (which he would have given me.)

Don't bother taking into account that minors can not own items so to restrict the transfer of property (from parent to child) is illegal and minors can not be bound to such agreements ...and I myself live in a joint property state so at the end of the day what is my husbands is mine and mine is his.",1,Negative

"I received 3 $10 gift cards for my birthday, and they are horrible. You can't fully scratch off the card to get the claim code and when you do, you can't read it. I've tried and tried to enter the codes to buy some books with my cards. Invalid entry. They're useless. Don't get the cards.",1,Negative
$25 for a $25 Amazon Gift card. Great for gifts and great for holiday presents when you don't know what exactly to get them. What more can I say? It arrives fast and free and comes in a nice packaging so no wrapping is necessary. All you need to do really is to write the person a note or letter for the occasion. Great!,5,Positive

It's just like having  $100. Except I couldn't get Walmart to accept it. Apparently you can only use it on the interweb at Amazon. That would've been nice to know before my purchase. If you are looking at gift card reviews maybe it's time to seek professional help.,3,Neutral

"I received a $50 Amazon gift card from my employer per an internal contest - yippee!
Could you implement the functionality that Apple has - allow the users devise's camera - in this case my Mac - to take a picture of the gift card code?
This will elevate errors when keying in the number and prove user friendly for customers with visual challengers.
Thank you,",1,Negative

"My Bad?  Have been trying to mail two, $100 gift cards to two different states. One to the father and the other to his son,
BUT they have the same birthday calendar date!!.

The first card was successfully received  but your program can't get it through its Corporate head that I would like the second card to go to a different email address to a different person..

I don't want to be billed for the second to be incorrectly recognized.  Maybe I should just put a USPS stamp on a personal check and send it???  At best I do not want to be billed for the number 2 effort until it is delivered ...if ever.",1,Negative
